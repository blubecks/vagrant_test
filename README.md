#Vagrant

I've find in Vagrant one of the best dev team's tool.

In this repository you can find my experiments with Vagrant + Ansible.

Each branch represents a specific development environment.

#Master branch

This is the most experimental branch, here I've learn the basics.

Trying:

    - hostmanager
    - run a script on vagrant up command
    - pass variables to the vagrantfile
