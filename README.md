#Vagrant

I've find in Vagrant one of the best dev team's tool.

In this repository you can find my experiments with Vagrant + Ansible.

Each branch represents a specific development environment.

#GX development branch

GX stands for turbogears, a python backend framework that we often use to go faster in prototypes development.
